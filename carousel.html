                            After the Abyss returned, our land becomes plagued and the entire southern part of the Land of Dawn turns into a barren place. Though the high Rantha Mountains blocks the corruption of the Abyss, Mother Nature in the southern realm continues to wither away. This once prosperous land is now nothing but a silent place filled with death, and people call it the “Despair Place”. The only passage that connects the Moniyan Empire is broken, separating the trapped refugees and the exiled wanderers from the rest of the world. They now live in fear and despair, haunted by monsters, yet still struggling to survive.

                          For these people, the name of Benedetta brings hope and a sense of security. This courageous, persevering female ranger leads a team and fights in the land south to the Rantha Mountains, protecting the scattered settlement set up by the last survivors in the Despair Place.

                          <h5>Lolita</h5>
                          Lolita was a gentle and tenacious half-elf girl. After she was rescued from the war and brought to Eruditio, she became a craftsman in the workshop. But she had an uncommon ambition: to join the Eruditio Rangers and fight like those who had rescued her. However, every battle proved to be overwhelming for her, because although she was a good fighter, she couldn't bear to hurt anyone. During an attack on the workshop, Lolita protected the Noumenon Energy Core with her body and was severely wounded. It was through this incident that her courage was acknowledged by the Eruditio Rangers, and they decided to take her in. Eventually, she understood that it didn't matter if one had destructive powers, because protecting too requires courage, and gentleness itself is also strength.

                          <h5>Cecilion</h5>
                          Many years ago, enjoying the night opera performed by Cecilion was the most popular form of entertainment for the people of Avalor. It was always full house at the theatre, each time this famous Opera actor performed. Everyone was attracted by his indescribable handsomeness and talent. However, the applause, love and cheers from human beings didn’t make Cecilion happy. He was a Blood Demon, and it was hard for him to open his mind to humans. He had always tried hard, to conceal his true identity and blend in with human society.
                            As a blood demon, Cecilion in love with human girl Carmilla, but cruel reality made Cecilion give up on their love. After Cecilion left, Carmilla chose to commit suicide which made Cecilion desperately sad. He used his abilities to turn Carmilla into Blood Demon. From then on, the two of them stayed away in the world together forever.
